Here are all scripts for the lesion probability mapping and reconstruction of the T1 T2* 
WM GM and Lesion Probability Maps. The script DeepLearning_MRFRecoAll_Regression.m loads 
all .mat MRF baseline files and generates the U-net with specific parameters and trains
the network. Furthermore, it can depict the training process and analyzis of the network
output and provides statistics and graphical representations also of the feature maps.

If you are interested in the MRF data, you need to request them here:
